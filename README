1. LOCAL AND REMOTE BACKUPS

0. Install boost C++ Libraries (http://www.boost.org/)

1. WINDOWS ONLY: install cygwin including sshd
     http://www.cygwin.com/
     http://pigtail.net/LRP/printsrv/cygwin-sshd.html
   on the windows machines which you want to run backupfs
   client. Windows machines can become *ONLY* backupfs clinets.
2. Open the backupfs source package on local host (server) and
   remote hosts
3. Run "make" on local host and remote hosts
4. Become root (Administrator on Windows) and run "make
   install" on local host and remote hosts.


2. UNIX BACKUPFS SERVER

1. Run "make ssh-keygen" to create an SSH authentication key
   pair with no passphrase.
2. Copy the secret key (id_rsa) to the backup root directory
   for a remote host as .id_rsa. If the backup root directory
   for host foo is /backup/foo, copy id_rsa as
   /backup/foo/.id_rsa. You can use the same secret key for
   multiple hosts as well as use a different key for each 
   remote host.


3. WINDOWS REMOTE BACKUPFS CLIENTS

1. Create an account "backupfs" with "Computer Administrator"
   privilege on a Windows machine
2. Run the following commands in a cygwin shell console:
     # ssh Administrator@localhost
     # mkpasswd -l > /etc/passwd
3. Change the group of all the files and directories under the
   top directory to be backed up to root. Use the following
   command if the top directory is /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and Settings/foo:
     chgrp -R root /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and Settings/foo
4. Change the access mode of all the files and directories
   under the top directory to be backed up so that backupfs can
   read. The following is example commands when the top
   directory is /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and Settings/foo:
     # find /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and Settings/foo -type d \
     -exec chmod 750 {} \;
     # find /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and Settings/foo -type f \
     -exec chmod 640 {} \;


4. REMOTE BACKUPFS CLIENTS

1. Add the matching SSH authentication public key (created in
   Section 2.1) to the $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file on each
   remotehost. In the above example, add the content of
   id_rsa.pub to foo:/home/backupfs/.ssh/authorized_keys.
2. Run backupfs against each remote host interactively. This is
   necessary to add SSH host keys to /root/.ssh/known_hosts.
   For example, run "backupfs foo:/etc /backup/foo" if you want
   to back up /etc on remote host foo into /backup/foo on the
   local host.
3. Once backupfs is run interactively against a remote host,
   you can use backupfs to back up the remote host's
   directories non-interactively.
